	<brief_description>
		An audio stream that synthesizes sound from a SoundFont2, driven by direct note commands.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[AudioStreamSoundfontPlayer] is an [AudioStream] that acts as a live SoundFont2 instrument. Unlike [AudioStreamMIDI], it does not require a MIDI file - instead, notes are triggered programmatically through the [AudioStreamPlaybackSoundfont] playback instance.
		Assign a [member soundfont] resource, play via an [AudioStreamPlayer], then obtain the playback with [method AudioStreamPlayer.get_stream_playback] and call [method AudioStreamPlaybackSoundfont.note_on] / [method AudioStreamPlaybackSoundfont.note_off] to produce sound. This is ideal for virtual keyboards and interactive music applications.
